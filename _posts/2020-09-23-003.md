Being our true authentic self is not that simple, but it all starts with self understanding, being vulnerable, acting with integrity and coherence ðŸ™‚


Don't be afraid to be yourself, to evolve yourself, and to care for yourself ðŸ’¯

You will always feel a little bit of fear, it's human, but don't let it block you from living your life!


I did this video to give the example and inspire you to look for your life purpose, too ðŸ™‚

After a 1-year-long process to clarify my life purpose, I wanted to share with the world:

Who I was, who I am, and who I â€” IÎ›CO VIVÎ›CI â€” am working to become!

You can comment in any of my videos, I will always reply

Ask me if you didn't understand something, or share your own purpose(s) ðŸ˜‰
