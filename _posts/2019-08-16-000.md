Hello world!

Finally my 1st video ;)

A super easy&delicious dessert: cookies!


Disclaimer: I am not cooking shirtless in the video, not this time ;)

These cookies are vegan and full-of-proteins!

I changed to a vegan diet a few months ago, and I had some difficulties in maintaining macros intake – now, these cookies will surely help me 💪😃

___

Recipe (*updated*)
+ 2 tbsp (30g) peanut butter
+ 3 tbsp (40g) flour (almond/wheat/oat/linseed)
+ 2 tsp (3g) cocoa
+ 1 tbsp (10g) sugar demerara/turbinado
+ (optional) some sunflower seeds

STEPS:
1. mix peanut, cocoa, and sugar
2. add flour, and some water to help mixing
3. microwave for 30s–60s
4. eat it :D

___

* 10g–15g of Proteins, depending on the type of flour
* It has all essential amino acids
* You can control the carbs and fats by reducing sugar and changing the flour

For the skinny ones (just like me) trying to gain muscle, it is a good option to add to our diets 😋

A recipe that is good for us, and our planet, too ;)

See you in our next adventure!
