Last weekend I celebrated my 1st vegan-bday! 🥳

This adventure has just began and I’ve already had great surprises, met amazing people, and saw I can change the world!

It all started with my quest to improve my nutrition, because I love to take good care #tgc of my body and health 🧖‍♂️.

Most people don’t realize, but our food is fundamental for an optimum health (together with rest 🧘‍♂️ and exercise 💪).

But soon, reading trustworthy sources (attention to fake news) I saw veganism has far more benefits than simply health:
- it’s also about #tgc and respecting animals (not just pets, everyone),
- and also about #tgc and preserving our planet (the only one we got 😉)

All people I met after I started this adventure are good, some even curious:
- where do you get your proteins?
- why such an “extreme” choice?
- but and milk/eggs/honey? 🐮🐔🐝

Some are already vegan (they inspire me, and often share “vegan secrets” about ~~conquering the world~~ 🤫 cooking).

And some even said I inspired them to make conscious choices (I love to hear I inspired someone to #tgc of their self)!
